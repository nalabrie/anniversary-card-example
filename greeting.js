  "This page is a sample of a real anniversary card I made for my girlfriend. Her name has been changed throughout but my name remains. The contents of the card have been changed to random Latin words. This pop-up alert was intended to be used as a greeting before the page loaded but I changed it to this explanation. This page is also optimized for phone screens. The layout automatically adjusts for small screens and the animation lessens dynamically."
